Ship of Death: (Jules Verne Fanfiction Adventure #1)
by Jonathan S. Mark

The 1860s saw the rise of the steam-powered metal warship and the decline of its predecessor, the wooden sailing vessel. US naval planners were aware of the potential of such iron-clad steamships and sought to construct one themselves. In the early 1860s various groups of officers (including Commander David Farragut, who was later to command the *Abraham Lincoln*) repeatedly approached President Lincoln and implored him to construct such a ship. At first President Lincoln ignored such requests but eventually he gave in.  

The battlecruiser *USS Saturn's Four Guitars* (which the Navy later renamed the *USS Abraham Lincoln* in the aftermath of Lincoln's assassination) was the first American steam-powered warship. President Lincoln's son Robert christened the ship in August 1866. But there was an unpleasant incident in the days leading up to the christening.

Lincoln's successor Andrew Johnson was on board his special train taking him to the christening in Annapolis, Maryland.  
[President Johnson asked to move his seat]

There were other unpleasant incidents. The glamorous American actress Girty Donderbeck was on hand for the ship's christening. On an impulse she jumped into the water while wearing a white sequined gown. The Navy had to rescue her. She later felt that the incident had damaged her career, although she had only done it for the publicity.

President Johnson gave his speech before the ship's christening and launch because to have had the speech afterwards would have been anticlimactic. Some American ships are launched into the water sideways but the Abraham Lincoln was launched down a greased chute.

The *Abraham Lincoln* quickly became the pride of the US Navy. It showed the US flag at trouble spots and at ceremonial occasions within the US.

[At first it took the public for rides]

[The symbolic importance of the ship]

In keeping with the ship's importance, the Navy made sure that everything on board was first class, including the food. The ship's stores included Subramanian apples imported all the way from India. When people eat those apples they get happy.

But one does not need to eat apples to be happy. After the ship's cristening ceremony some sailors snuck some showgirls on board and everyone got a little too happy. Some of the showgirls were Jewish. You could tell which ones were Jewish by asking them if they were from Long Island. One of the girls said she would have sex with the sailors if they paid her, but there was no place to do it, so everyone just danced. The fiddler only knew how to play one song, "Roses in the Woods", so he just played it over and over again and no one cared.

If the *USS Abraham Lincoln* ever sunk the effect on US morale would be enormous.
